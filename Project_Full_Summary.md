# Informer Time Series Forecasting - Full Project Documentation

---

## 📈 1. Project Overview

This project implements the **Informer** deep learning architecture from scratch for **long-sequence time series forecasting**.
We used the **ETT-small** real-world dataset (Electricity Transformer Temperature).

✅ Focus: Predict future values given historical patterns.
✅ Key Architecture: Encoder-Decoder with ProbSparse Attention.

## 🌟 5. Challenges We Solved Together

| Challenge | How We Solved It |
|:----------|:-----------------|
| Shape mismatches in attention layers | Carefully debugged tensor shapes and dimension expectations |
| Decoder input creation errors | Corrected dec_inp size to (label_len + pred_len) |
| Using GPU properly | Installed correct CUDA version, moved model and tensors to device |
| Training validation split | Introduced simple validation data loader |
| Managing large venv/ folder | Created .gitignore, removed venv from git tracking |
| Pushing to GitHub cleanly | Clean commits, branch renamed to main, pushed with README |

✅ We tackled every issue **one-by-one** until the project was solid!

---

## 🌍 6. Final Results

| Metric | Value |
|:-------|:------|
| Final Training Loss | ~0.07 |
| Test MAE | 1.0684 |
| Test RMSE | 1.4173 |

✅ Forecasting plots confirmed good trend tracking, minor amplitude shrinkage noted.

✅ Project polished and deployed like real-world ML engineer standards.

## 🚀 7. Future Scope

- Add MinMax normalization for better magnitude learning
- Try deeper Informer architectures (more encoder layers)
- Add EarlyStopping based on validation loss
- Experiment with different datasets (traffic forecasting, stock data)
- Optimize model using AdamW or other optimizers
- Deploy model using Flask or FastAPI for real-world inference APIs
